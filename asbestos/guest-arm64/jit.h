#ifndef ASBESTOS_ARM64_JIT_H
#define ASBESTOS_ARM64_JIT_H

// Native JIT for the ARM64 guest (build option -Djit=true, defines ISH_JIT).
//
// A layer on top of the threaded-code blocks: after a block's gadget stream is
// generated, runs of supported guest instructions are translated to host code
// in a MAP_JIT region and the first gadget pointer of each run is replaced by
// a pointer to that code. Anything else still runs as gadgets, so block
// chaining, ret_cache and the fallback paths are those of the gadget engine.
//
// - The hottest guest registers live in fixed host registers across native
//   code and are stored back whenever control leaves it.
// - Loads/stores inline the TLB lookup; a miss resumes the unit's gadget.
// - Block ends (b/bl/b.cond/cbz/tbz/ret/br/blr) are translated; chained
//   successors are reached through patched direct branches.
//
// Without ISH_JIT none of this is compiled and every hook below is absent, so
// the default build is the plain gadget engine. With it, ISH_JIT=0 in the
// environment turns the translator off at run time (the BLR code stream keeps
// its JIT layout). Tuning / diagnostics: ISH_JIT_PIN=0, ISH_JIT_LINK=0,
// ISH_JIT_LOOP=0, ISH_JIT_SIMD=0, ISH_JIT_STATS=1, ISH_JIT_DUMP=<file>,
// ISH_JIT_MAP=<file> (native code -> guest module and file offset).
//
// ISH_JIT_PIC=1 emits position-independent code (jit.c, "PIC"): nothing in it
// depends on where the guest module or its blocks live, and a registry reuses
// a translation for every block with the same key, across processes.
//
// AOT: in PIC mode ISH_JIT_RECORD=<file> writes the translations of one module
// (ISH_JIT_RECORD_MOD, default ld-musl) at exit, and tools/jit_aot turns them
// into an image that a target links in (aot.h). A build with -Djit_emit=false
// runs only such images and never maps executable memory; ISH_JIT_AOT_ONLY=1
// does the same in a JIT build.
